# 🧠 SwinUNETR-BraTS21

A PyTorch-based implementation of SwinUNETR for 3D brain tumor segmentation on the [BraTS 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dschettler8845/brats-2021-task1) dataset, leveraging [MONAI](https://monai.io/) for efficient medical imaging workflows. This notebook explores how transformer-based architectures, specifically Swin Transformers, can enhance volumetric segmentation performance in medical imaging tasks.

## Task

The goal is to segment brain tumor subregions from multimodal 3D MRI scans. The subregions include:
- **ET**: Enhancing Tumor
- **WT**: Whole Tumor
- **TC**: Tumor Core

---

## Model

We use **SwinUNETR**, a hybrid architecture combining Swin Transformer blocks with the UNETR framework. It is particularly suited for 3D medical imaging due to its ability to model long-range dependencies while maintaining spatial precision.

> This notebook handles:
- Loading 3D MRI modalities (`T1`, `T1ce`, `T2`, `FLAIR`)
- Preprocessing (resampling, normalization, cropping)
- 3D volume segmentation
- Evaluation using Dice Score

**Note:** This model was trained for **only 1 epoch** and achieved a **Dice score of 0.68**. The goal is to demonstrate a working pipeline, not optimized performance.
