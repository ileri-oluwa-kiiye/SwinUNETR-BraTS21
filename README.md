# SwinUNETR-BraTS21
Implementation of SwinUNETR for 3D brain tumor segmentation using the BraTS 2021 dataset. Built with MONAI and PyTorch, this notebook explores transformer-based architectures for volumetric medical image segmentation, tackling the task of delineating tumor subregions (ET, WT, TC) in MRI scans.
